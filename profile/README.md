## GDWired

This organization aims to create connectivity tools for Godot using BLE, Serial, MQTT.
Godot4 is now available! but not GDExtention... as soon as the version is available, I will develop the GD4 version of all repositories.

For now there is:
 - GDSimpleBLE wrapping of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) library SimpleBLE (https://github.com/OpenBluetoothToolbox/SimpleBLE)
 - GDMosquitto wrapping of MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) library libmosquitto (https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto)
 - GDPaho wrapping of MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) library paho.mqtt.cpp (https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.cpp)
 - GDOfSerial wrapping of the standalone serial communication part (https://github.com/jferdelyi/ofSerial) of OpenFramework (https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks)
 
In the futur:
 - GDOfFirmata wrapping of the standalone firmata communication part (TODO) of OpenFramework (https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks)
